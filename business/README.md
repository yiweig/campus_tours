# Hypotheses and Feedback  

### Hypotheses:
1. People would like a voice to speak to them rather than read text  
2. People would like the ability to see their path on the map  
3. People would like the app to track their location by GPS

### Survey Responses:

*Nicole (Tour guide):*  
    * Should have someone speaking  
    * Users should be able to add/remove sections of the tour they don't like

*David (Tour guide):*  
    * Someone needs to be speaking  
    * Tapping on a building should show information about that building  

*Megan (Tour guide):*  
    * It should be like the GPS for navigating, where the map follows you where ever you walk

*Mark (Prospective student):*  
    * Information about every building on the route, in case someone is interested in it  
    * A way to contact an admissions counselor at the conclusion of the tour for further questions  
    * A way to rate the tour

*Malisha (Admissions counselor):*  
    * Updated constantly, and should have information about things that aren't covered in the normal tour  
    * Track metrics on users, such as favorite points of interests, favorite parts of the route, etc.

### Conclusions:

Based on this information, we can see that a lot of people would benefit from a mobile app that serves to replace the self guided tour brochure. Since a mobile app is much more interactive, many people expect the app the lead a tour not through text but through speaking. Since visual and audio cues are better, many respondents also requested that we include a map feature that will show the user's current location as well as the tour route.  

Since many of these features are either already implemented or are on our list of features, we can confidently say that our project is progressing at a great pace in the right direction.
